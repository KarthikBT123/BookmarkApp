## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables
Run the PowerShell script as Administrator:
```powershell
.\setup-stripe-env.ps1
```

### 2. Restart Your Development Environment
After setting environment variables, restart:
- Your IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse/VS Code)
- Your terminal/command prompt

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
cd BookmarkApp-master
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 4. Test the Integration
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/plans`
2. Click on "Choose Pro" or "Choose Ultra"
3. You'll be redirected to your Stripe payment pages
4. **⚠️ Important**: These are LIVE payment links - they will charge real money!

### 5. Payment Redirect Options

**Current Setup**: Users pay on Stripe and stay on Stripe's success page

**To redirect back to your app after payment:**

**Option A: Update Your Stripe Payment Links (Easiest)**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard → Payment Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links)
2. Edit your Pro/Ultra payment links
3. Add Success URL: `https://bookmarkapps.devaccellabs.com/api/stripe/payment-success?plan=pro`
4. Add Cancel URL: `https://bookmarkapps.devaccellabs.com/plans`

**Option B: Use Dynamic Checkout (Already Coded)**
1. In `PaymentPlanScreen.java`, uncomment the alternative checkout code
2. The `baseUrl` is already set to your domain: `https://bookmarkapps.devaccellabs.com`
3. Users will redirect to your custom success page → MainScreen

## 🔧 Optional: Set Up Webhooks (Recommended)

For automatic plan updates after payment, set up webhooks:

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Set endpoint URL: `https://bookmarkapps.devaccellabs.com/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret
6. Set it as environment variable:
   ```powershell
   setx STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET "whsec_your_webhook_secret_here" /M
   ```
